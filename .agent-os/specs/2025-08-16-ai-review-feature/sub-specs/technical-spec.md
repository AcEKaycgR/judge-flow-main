# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-16-ai-review-feature/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- Implement AI Review models in Django to store analysis results
- Create API endpoints for comprehensive AI review and problem-specific review
- Integrate the existing frontend AI Review page with the new backend APIs
- Implement code analysis algorithms for quality assessment
- Create progress tracking system that analyzes user submission history
- Implement visualization components for progress tracking
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization for AI review features
- Handle error cases gracefully with appropriate user feedback

## External Dependencies (Conditional)

- **openai** - For advanced AI code analysis capabilities
- **Justification:** While we'll start with rule-based analysis, having the option to integrate with OpenAI's API would allow for more sophisticated code review capabilities in the future. This would be an optional feature that can be enabled if desired.
