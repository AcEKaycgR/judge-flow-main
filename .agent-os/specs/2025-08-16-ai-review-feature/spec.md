# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AI Review Feature
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the AI Review functionality to provide automated code analysis and feedback to users. This feature will analyze submitted code and provide suggestions for improvement, helping users learn better coding practices and improve their skills.

## User Stories

### AI Code Analysis and Feedback

As a user, I want to receive AI-powered feedback on my code submissions, so that I can understand areas for improvement and learn better coding practices.

The user will submit their code solution to a problem, and the system will analyze the code using AI algorithms to provide feedback on:
- Code quality and readability
- Performance optimizations
- Best practices and patterns
- Potential bugs or issues
- Style guide compliance

The feedback will be presented in a structured format with actionable suggestions.

### Comprehensive Progress Analysis

As a user, I want to view a comprehensive analysis of my coding progress over time, so that I can track my improvement and identify areas that need more focus.

The system will analyze the user's submission history to generate insights about:
- Overall accuracy and progress trends
- Strengths and weaknesses in different problem categories
- Improvement over time in specific areas
- Comparison with community benchmarks

This analysis will be presented through visualizations and structured feedback.

## Spec Scope

1. **AI Review Backend Implementation** - Create Django models, views, and APIs for AI code analysis
2. **AI Review Frontend Integration** - Connect the existing AI Review page to the backend API
3. **Code Analysis Algorithms** - Implement algorithms for code quality assessment and feedback generation
4. **Progress Tracking System** - Create system for analyzing user progress over time
5. **Visualization Components** - Implement charts and graphs for progress tracking

## Out of Scope

- Integration with external AI services (using local analysis algorithms)
- Real-time code analysis during typing
- Peer review functionality
- Advanced machine learning models (using rule-based analysis)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional AI Review page that displays meaningful feedback on code submissions
2. Working API endpoints that return structured AI analysis results
3. Integrated progress tracking with visualizations showing user improvement over time
