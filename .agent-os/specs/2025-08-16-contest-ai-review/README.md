# Contest and AI Review Implementation

## Description
This specification implements the connection between frontend contest pages and backend APIs, along with enhanced AI review functionality that provides personalized feedback to users.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Contest System
- **Contest Listing**: Displays all contests with proper status (upcoming, active, ended)
- **Contest Details**: Shows contest problems and allows participation
- **Contest Creation**: Allows administrators to create new contests
- **Code Editor**: Integrated code editor with run/submit functionality
- **Timer**: Built-in timer for tracking time spent on problems
- **Submissions**: Tracks all contest submissions in the main submissions page

### 2. AI Review System
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyzes user's coding patterns across all submissions
- **Personalized Feedback**: Provides detailed feedback on code quality and improvements
- **Learning Resources**: Recommends YouTube videos, courses, and books for skill development
- **Practice Problems**: Suggests targeted practice problems based on user's weaknesses
- **Visual Dashboard**: Interactive UI with clear presentation of all recommendations

## Technical Details

### Backend
- Django REST Framework APIs for contest and submission management
- PostgreSQL database with proper relationships between models
- Authentication and authorization using Django's built-in system
- Comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript for type-safe development
- TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Tailwind CSS for responsive UI design
- Reusable components for consistent user experience

### APIs
- `/api/contests/` - List and create contests
- `/api/contests/{id}/` - Get contest details
- `/api/contests/{id}/submissions/` - Get contest submissions
- `/api/comprehensive-ai-review/` - Generate AI review based on user history

## How to Use

### Contests
1. Navigate to the Contests page to view all available contests
2. Click on a contest to view its details and problems
3. Select a problem to open the code editor
4. Write your solution and use the Run button to test it
5. Use the Submit button to submit your solution for evaluation
6. Track your progress with the built-in timer

### AI Review
1. Navigate to the AI Review page from the navigation menu
2. View comprehensive analysis of your coding patterns
3. Explore recommended learning resources
4. Practice suggested problems to improve your skills

## Testing
- Backend unit tests for all API endpoints
- Frontend component tests for UI rendering
- Integration tests for complete user workflows
- Manual testing of all user-facing features

## Future Enhancements
- Contest management (edit/delete functionality)
- Real AI integration for more accurate feedback
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Leaderboards for competitive programming contests

This implementation provides a solid foundation for competitive programming platforms with intelligent feedback systems.
