## Overview

Connect the frontend contest page to the backend API and implement the backend logic for contest functionality. Additionally, create an AI review page that provides feedback by collecting data from user submissions and gives recommendations including error analysis, YouTube video recommendations, course recommendations, and practice questions.

## User Stories

### Connect Frontend Contest Page to Backend

As a developer, I want to connect the frontend contest page to the backend API so that users can view real contests and participate in them.

The frontend currently uses mock data to display contests. We need to replace this with real data from the backend API. The backend already has contest models and views implemented, but we need to ensure the frontend is properly connected to fetch and display this data.

### Implement AI Review Page

As a user, I want to see AI-powered feedback on my submissions so that I can improve my coding skills.

The AI review page should collect data from a user's submissions and provide personalized feedback including:
- Error analysis and suggestions for improvement
- YouTube video recommendations related to concepts I'm struggling with
- Course recommendations to strengthen my knowledge
- Practice questions tailored to my weaknesses

## Spec Scope

1. **Frontend Contest Integration** - Connect the contests page to fetch real data from the backend API
2. **Backend Contest Logic** - Implement complete backend logic for contest creation and management
3. **AI Review Page** - Create a comprehensive AI review page that provides personalized feedback
4. **Submission Data Collection** - Implement backend logic to collect and analyze user submissions for AI review

## Out of Scope

- Creating new contest creation functionality in the frontend
- Implementing actual AI models (we'll continue using mock data for now)
- Modifying existing contest models in the database

## Expected Deliverable

1. Contests page displays real data from the backend API instead of mock data
2. AI review page shows personalized feedback based on user submissions
3. All contest-related API endpoints are properly connected and functional
4. User can view AI feedback that includes error analysis, recommendations, and practice suggestions
