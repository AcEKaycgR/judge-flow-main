# Spec Summary (Lite)

Connect the React frontend to the Django backend APIs to replace mock data with real data. This feature will enable the application to fetch live data from the backend, authenticate users, submit code, and display real-time results. This integration is critical for transforming the application from a static demo to a fully functional online judge platform.
