# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Frontend Backend Integration
> Created: 2025-08-13
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Connect the React frontend to the Django backend APIs to replace mock data with real data. This feature will enable the application to fetch live data from the backend, authenticate users, submit code, and display real-time results. This integration is critical for transforming the application from a static demo to a fully functional online judge platform.

## User Stories

### Connect Frontend to Backend APIs

As a developer, I want to replace all mock data with real API calls so that the application fetches live data from the backend. This will involve updating all frontend components to use the existing API client and handle real API responses.

The workflow involves:
1. Identifying all components that currently use mock data
2. Replacing mock data calls with real API calls
3. Handling loading states and error responses
4. Ensuring data structures match between frontend and backend

### Implement Authentication Flow

As a user, I want to be able to log in and out of the application so that I can access my personalized data and submissions. This requires connecting the login and signup pages to the backend authentication endpoints and managing session state in the frontend.

The workflow involves:
1. Connecting login page to backend authentication endpoint
2. Connecting signup page to backend user creation endpoint
3. Managing user session state in the frontend
4. Protecting routes that require authentication
5. Implementing logout functionality

## Spec Scope

1. **API Integration** - Replace mock data with real API calls in all frontend components
2. **Authentication Flow** - Connect login/signup pages to backend and manage user sessions
3. **Error Handling** - Implement proper error handling for API calls
4. **Loading States** - Add loading indicators for async operations
5. **Route Protection** - Protect routes that require authentication

## Out of Scope

- Adding new API endpoints to the backend
- Changing existing backend functionality
- Implementing new frontend features
- Performance optimization

## Expected Deliverable

1. All frontend pages fetch real data from backend APIs instead of using mock data
2. Authentication flow works with backend endpoints
3. Proper error handling and loading states for all API calls
4. Protected routes that require authentication
