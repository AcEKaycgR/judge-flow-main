# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-15-user-authentication-e2e/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend

1.  **Auth Context**: An `AuthContext` will be implemented in React to provide global state for authentication status (e.g., `isAuthenticated`), user data (e.g., `user`), and authentication functions (`login`, `signup`, `logout`). This context will be initialized by checking for a session token on application load.
2.  **API Service**: A dedicated API service module (e.g., `lib/api.ts`) will be updated to include functions for making `POST` requests to the `/api/accounts/signup/`, `/api/accounts/login/`, and `/api/accounts/logout/` endpoints.
3.  **HTTP Client**: The frontend's HTTP client (likely `fetch` or a wrapper) must be configured to handle credentials (cookies) to maintain the session state with the Django backend.
4.  **Form Handling**: The Login and Signup forms, built with `react-hook-form`, will be connected to the API service. Form validation errors from the backend should be displayed to the user.
5.  **Protected Routes**: A `ProtectedRoute` component will be created. It will check the `AuthContext` and redirect unauthenticated users to the `/login` page.
6.  **Error Handling**: Implement global error handling for API requests to gracefully manage network errors or unexpected server responses.

### Backend

1.  **Session Management**: Django's built-in session authentication will be used. On login, a session cookie will be set. On logout, this session will be terminated.
2.  **CSRF Protection**: Django's CSRF protection mechanism must be correctly handled by the frontend. The frontend will need to acquire a CSRF token and include it in the headers of all state-changing requests (`POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`). A dedicated endpoint to fetch the CSRF token might be needed if not handled automatically.
3.  **View Logic**: The `user_login`, `user_signup`, and `user_logout` views in the `accounts` app must be reviewed and completed to handle JSON requests and responses correctly.
    *   `user_signup`: Must validate input, create a `User` and `UserProfile`, log the user in, and return a success response.
    *   `user_login`: Must authenticate credentials, create a session, and return user data.
    *   `user_logout`: Must terminate the session and return a success response.

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies are anticipated for this spec. All required libraries (`react-router-dom`, `react-hook-form`, `djangorestframework`) are already part of the project.
