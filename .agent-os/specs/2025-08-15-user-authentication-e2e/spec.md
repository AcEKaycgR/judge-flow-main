> Spec: User Authentication End-to-End
> Created: 2025-08-15
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This spec covers the implementation of a complete, end-to-end user authentication system. The primary goal is to replace the frontend's mock authentication with a real connection to the backend API, allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.

## User Stories

### New User Registration

*   **As a** new user,
*   **I want to** create an account using my email and a password,
*   **so that** I can access the platform's features.
*   **Details**: The user should be able to navigate to a signup page, fill in their details, and upon successful registration, be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard.

### Existing User Login

*   **As an** existing user,
*   **I want to** log in with my email and password,
*   **so that** I can access my profile and continue using the platform.
*   **Details**: The user should be able to enter their credentials on a login page. Upon success, they should be redirected to the dashboard. Upon failure, a clear error message should be displayed.

### User Logout

*   **As an** authenticated user,
*   **I want to** log out of my account,
*   **so that** I can securely end my session.
*   **Details**: A logout button should be available. Clicking it should terminate the session and redirect the user to the login or home page.

## Spec Scope

1.  **Signup Page Integration**: Wire up the registration form to the `api/accounts/signup/` backend endpoint.
2.  **Login Page Integration**: Wire up the login form to the `api/accounts/login/` backend endpoint.
3.  **Logout Functionality**: Implement the logout action to call the `api/accounts/logout/` endpoint.
4.  **Frontend Auth State Management**: Create a context or store in the frontend to manage the user's authentication status and profile information globally.
5.  **Protected Routes**: Implement logic to prevent unauthenticated users from accessing protected pages like the Dashboard or Playground.

## Out of Scope

- "Forgot Password" or password reset functionality.
- User profile editing (viewing basic info is in scope).
- Two-factor authentication.
- "Remember me" functionality.

## Expected Deliverable

1.  A new user can successfully create an account and is automatically logged in.
2.  An existing user can log in and out of the application.
3.  Protected pages are inaccessible to users who are not logged in.
