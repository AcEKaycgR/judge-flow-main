# Spec Tasks

This document breaks down the work required to implement the User Authentication End-to-End spec.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. **Implement Backend API Endpoints**
    - [ ] 1.1 Write or update Django tests for the `signup`, `login`, `logout`, and `profile` views to assert correct behavior for valid/invalid inputs and authentication states.
    - [ ] 1.2 Implement the `signup` view logic in `accounts/views.py` to handle user creation, validation, and automatic login.
    - [ ] 1.3 Implement the `login` view logic to authenticate users and establish a session.
    - [ ] 1.4 Implement the `logout` view logic to properly terminate the user's session.
    - [ ] 1.5 Implement the `user_profile` view to return data for the currently authenticated user.
    - [ ] 1.6 Run the backend test suite to ensure all authentication tests pass.

- [ ] 2. **Develop Frontend Authentication Service**
    - [ ] 2.1 Write unit tests for the frontend authentication functions (signup, login, logout).
    - [ ] 2.2 Create an `AuthContext` in React (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) to manage and provide global authentication state and user data.
    - [ ] 2.3 Implement the API functions in `src/lib/api.ts` to communicate with the backend authentication endpoints.
    - [ ] 2.4 Configure the root of the application to initialize the `AuthContext` by checking for an active session on page load.
    - [ ] 2.5 Verify all frontend unit tests for the auth service pass.

- [ ] 3. **Integrate Frontend Components**
    - [ ] 3.1 Write integration tests for the Login and Signup pages.
    - [ ] 3.2 Connect the `Signup` page form (`src/pages/Signup.tsx`) to the `signup` function from the auth service.
    - [ ] 3.3 Connect the `Login` page form (`src/pages/Login.tsx`) to the `login` function from the auth service, including handling and displaying login errors.
    - [ ] 3.4 Implement the `logout` button in the UI to call the `logout` function.
    - [ ] 3.5 Create a `ProtectedRoute` component that wraps pages and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.
    - [ ] 3.6 Apply the `ProtectedRoute` to all necessary routes in the main application router.
    - [ ] 3.7 Manually test the full authentication flow: signup, logout, login, accessing protected pages, and being redirected when logged out.
