# Spec Tasks

This document breaks down the work required to implement the Compiler Integration for Code Editor and Playground spec.

## Tasks

- [x] 1. **Update CodeEditor Component**
    - [x] 1.1 Write tests for the CodeEditor component's run functionality
    - [x] 1.2 Modify CodeEditor to use the `runCode` API instead of mock execution
    - [x] 1.3 Add input field for custom test data
    - [x] 1.4 Add output panel for displaying execution results
    - [x] 1.5 Implement loading states during code execution
    - [x] 1.6 Add proper error handling for API failures
    - [x] 1.7 Verify all tests pass

- [x] 2. **Integrate Problem Detail Page**
    - [x] 2.1 Write tests for the problem detail page's code execution features
    - [ ] 2.2 Add input/output panels below the code editor
    - [ ] 2.3 Connect the panels to the CodeEditor component
    - [ ] 2.4 Ensure the existing submission flow remains unchanged
    - [ ] 2.5 Verify all tests pass

- [ ] 3. **Enhance Playground Page**
    - [ ] 3.1 Write tests for the playground's code execution features
    - [ ] 3.2 Add input/output panels to the playground interface
    - [ ] 3.3 Connect the panels to the CodeEditor component
    - [ ] 3.4 Ensure all functionality works with the compiler API
    - [ ] 3.5 Verify all tests pass

- [ ] 4. **Testing and Validation**
    - [ ] 4.1 Test all supported languages (Python, JavaScript, C++)
    - [ ] 4.2 Test error handling for various failure scenarios
    - [ ] 4.3 Test timeout handling
    - [ ] 4.4 Perform end-to-end testing of the complete flow
    - [ ] 4.5 Verify all existing functionality still works correctly
