# Database Schema

This is the database schema implementation for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-15-compiler-integration/spec.md

## Changes

No database schema changes are required for this spec. The implementation will use existing database structures and API endpoints.

## Specifications

This spec focuses on frontend/backend integration and does not require any database migrations or schema modifications.

## Rationale

The compiler integration spec is purely about connecting existing frontend components to existing backend API endpoints. All necessary data structures are already in place, and the functionality leverages existing compiler service capabilities.
