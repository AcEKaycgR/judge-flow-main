# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Compiler Integration for Code Editor and Playground
> Created: 2025-08-15
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This spec details the integration of the code editor and playground components with the backend compiler service. The goal is to enable users to run and test their code directly from the problem-solving interface and the playground, leveraging the existing compiler API endpoints.

## User Stories

### Run Code in Problem Context

As a user solving a programming problem, I want to run my code with custom input directly from the problem detail page, so that I can test my solution before submitting it for formal evaluation.

When I'm working on a problem, I should be able to:
1. Write or modify my code in the editor
2. Provide custom input to test with
3. Click a "Run" button to execute my code
4. See the output and any errors in a dedicated output panel
5. Iterate quickly without submitting for formal evaluation

### Run Code in Playground

As a user in the playground, I want to execute my code snippets with custom input, so that I can experiment and test programming concepts without the overhead of a formal problem.

When I'm in the playground, I should be able to:
1. Write code in any supported language
2. Provide input data for testing
3. Execute the code with a "Run" button
4. See the output and any errors
5. Save, share, or download my code snippets

## Spec Scope

1. **CodeEditor Component Updates** - Modify the CodeEditor component to use the compiler's `runCode` API instead of mock execution
2. **Problem Detail Page Integration** - Add input/output panels to the problem detail page for testing code before submission
3. **Playground Page Integration** - Enhance the playground with input/output capabilities using the compiler API
4. **Error Handling** - Implement proper error handling for code execution failures, timeouts, and unsupported languages
5. **UI/UX Improvements** - Add loading states, clear output formatting, and execution metadata (runtime, etc.)

## Out of Scope

- Modifying the formal submission flow (this will continue to use the existing problem evaluation system)
- Adding new programming languages beyond what the compiler already supports
- Implementing code completion or linting features
- Creating persistent storage for playground snippets (beyond the current local state)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can run code directly from the problem detail page with custom input
2. Users can run code in the playground with input/output handling
3. Both interfaces properly display execution results and errors
4. The implementation follows existing code patterns and reuses available API functions
5. All new functionality is properly tested and documented
