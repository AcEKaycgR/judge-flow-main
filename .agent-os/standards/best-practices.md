# Development Best Practices

## Context

Global development guidelines for my Agent OS projects — primarily solo or small team projects built with Django, React, and TailwindCSS.

## Core Principles

###  Keep It Simple
- Use the **simplest solution** that works — no overengineering
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction, especially in early stages
- Don’t optimize prematurely — focus on getting it working, then improving it

###  Optimize for Readability
- Write **clear, understandable code**
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment only when needed — focus on the "why", not the "what"
- Clean, readable code is more valuable than clever hacks

###  DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Reuse code through:
  - Python functions, Django model methods, or helper utilities
  - React components or custom hooks
- Avoid copying/pasting large blocks — refactor common patterns

###  File & Folder Structure
- Group related files together (e.g., Django apps, React components)
- Keep each file focused on **one responsibility**
- Use consistent and descriptive file/folder names
- Avoid bloated files (split views, utils, or components when needed)

## Using Third-Party Libraries

###  Choose Dependencies Wisely
Before adding a package or library (Python, npm, etc.):
- Prefer popular, well-documented, actively maintained tools
- Check:
  -  GitHub stars and contributors
  -  Recent commits (within 6–12 months)
  -  Clear usage docs and community support
- Avoid libraries with many unresolved issues or slow updates

---

## Workflow Tips (Optional for Solo Dev)

- Use **version control** (Git + GitHub) for everything — commit regularly
- Use **branches** for features or experiments (`feature/`, `test/`, etc.)
- Write clear commit messages: `fix: login bug`, `add: search bar to header`
- Track TODOs in code with `# TODO:` or use Issues/Projects on GitHub

---

## When You Get Stuck

- Start with **minimal reproducible code** and build upward
- Use tools like ChatGPT, Stack Overflow, or GitHub Copilot to unblock
- Don't be afraid to ask for help — speed matters more than ego

---

## Long-Term Goals (For Startup Projects)

- Add tests as your app grows (Django unit tests, React testing library)
- Automate deploys with CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Render, etc.)
- Monitor code quality and maintainability
