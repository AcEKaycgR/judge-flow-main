# Product Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for JudgeFlow, reflecting the current state of the project and future goals.

## Phase 0: Foundation & UI Mockups (Completed)

This phase involved setting up the project structure and developing the frontend user interface with mock data.

- [x] **Backend Scaffolding**: Initial Django project setup with applications for `accounts`, `problems`, `contests`, and `compiler`.
- [x] **Database Models**: Core data models for users, problems, contests, and submissions defined in Django.
- [x] **Frontend UI Development**: The user interface for all major features was created using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- [x] **Component Library**: A comprehensive set of UI components was built using Shadcn UI.
- [x] **UI Mockups**: The frontend was populated with mock data to enable visual development and establish the target user experience.

## Phase 1: Backend Implementation & Frontend Integration

This is the current and primary focus. The goal is to connect the frontend to a fully functional backend.

- [x] **Connect Frontend to Backend**: Systematically replace all mock data in the frontend with live data by integrating with the backend API.
- [x] **Complete Backend Views**: Implement the business logic in all Django views to fully support the functionality required by the frontend.
- [x] **Implement Code Execution Engine**: Build the compiler service to handle code submissions in Python, JavaScript, and C++. This includes managing security and resource limits.
- [x] **Problem & Contest Logic**: Flesh out the backend logic for creating and managing problems with both shown and hidden test cases. Implement the functionality for creating contests from the existing pool of problems.
- [x] **User Authentication Flow**: Ensure the login, signup, and session management are robustly connected to the backend.

## Phase 2: AI-Powered Insights

Once the core platform is functional, the focus will shift to the AI-driven features.

- [ ] **Implement AI Review Feature**: Develop the backend logic to retrieve a user's last 10 submissions, analyze them using an AI model, and generate targeted feedback and recommendations.
- [ ] **Integrate AI Review with Frontend**: Create the API endpoint for the AI review and display the analysis on the dedicated frontend page.

## Phase 3: Polish & Refinement

This phase involves improving the overall quality and preparing for a stable release.

- [ ] **Refine User Experience**: Address any UI/UX inconsistencies and bugs.
- [ ] **Testing**: Add more comprehensive tests for both the frontend and backend to ensure reliability.
- [ ] **Deployment Preparation**: If desired, prepare the application for production by configuring a production-ready database, web server, and static file handling.
