# JudgeFlow Project Summary

## Project Overview

JudgeFlow is an online judge platform that allows users to solve programming problems, participate in coding contests, and improve their programming skills. The platform provides a comprehensive environment for coding practice with features like real-time code execution, automated testing, and AI-powered code review.

The JudgeFlow project is nearly complete with most features implemented. Both the frontend and backend are fully functional and integrated, with the exception of the AI Review feature which is still pending implementation.

### Backend Status
- ✅ Complete REST API implementation
- ✅ User authentication system
- ✅ Problem and contest management

- ✅ Page structure for all required features
- ✅ Real API integration for all pages except AI Review
- ✅ Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Proper loading states and error handling

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation
- TanStack Query for server state management

### Backend
- Django with Django REST Framework
- SQLite database (development)

## Next Steps

1. Implement AI Review functionality in the backend
2. Connect AI Review frontend page to backend API
3. Add social features and user profiles
4. Optimize for mobile devices
5. Prepare for production deployment with Docker and PostgreSQL

## Team Information

This is a solo project developed by a full-stack developer with experience in both frontend and backend technologies. The project follows best practices for modern web development and is designed to be extensible for future features.
