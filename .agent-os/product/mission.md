# Mission: JudgeFlow

## Main Idea

To create a simple and intuitive online judge platform designed for students and competitive programmers. The platform facilitates practicing problem-solving skills, competing in programming contests, and receiving AI-powered feedback to guide improvement. As a college project, the focus is on core functionality and a clean user experience over feature complexity.

## Core Problem

The project addresses the need for an accessible, easy-to-use platform where students can practice coding, prepare for technical interviews, and participate in friendly competitions without the overwhelming complexity of professional-grade competitive programming sites.

## Target Users

*   **Students**: University and college students learning data structures, algorithms, and software development.
*   **Competitive Programmers**: Beginners and intermediate programmers looking for a platform to hone their skills.
