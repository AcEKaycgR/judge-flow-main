# Decision Log: JudgeFlow Platform

## Technical Decisions

- **Django for Backend**: Chosen for its robust ORM, built-in admin interface, and rapid development capabilities
- **React for Frontend**: Selected for its component-based architecture and rich ecosystem
- **RESTful API Design**: All features exposed via RESTful APIs for clear separation of concerns
- **Session-based Authentication**: Using Django's built-in session authentication for simplicity
- **Modular Django App Structure**: Backend organized into separate apps (accounts, problems, contests, compiler) for maintainability
- **TypeScript for Frontend**: Provides type safety and better developer experience
- **SQLite for Development**: Simple setup for development, with PostgreSQL planned for production
- **Component-based Frontend Architecture**: React components organized by feature for reusability

## Product Decisions

- **Online Judge Focus**: Platform centered around coding problem solving and contest participation
- **Real-time Code Execution**: Immediate feedback on code submissions
- **AI-powered Code Review**: Automated feedback on code quality and improvements
- **Progress Tracking**: User statistics and problem-solving history
- **Contest Participation**: Competitive programming features with timed challenges

## Development Decisions

- **Separate Frontend/Backend**: Clear separation allows independent development and scaling
- **Mock Data First Approach**: Frontend developed with mock data before backend integration
- **API Client Pattern**: Centralized API client for consistent backend communication
- **Task-based Development**: Clear task list for frontend-backend integration
