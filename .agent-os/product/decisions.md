# Technical Decisions

This document is for recording the key architectural and technical decisions made throughout the project's lifecycle.

Currently, no major historical decisions have been noted. This file serves as a placeholder for future documentation.

As the project evolves, record decisions here, such as:

*   **Technology Choices**: Why was a specific library or framework chosen over an alternative?
*   **Architectural Patterns**: What design patterns were implemented and why?
*   **API Design**: Justifications for the structure of API endpoints and data models.
*   **Database Schema**: Reasons behind the design of the database schema.
